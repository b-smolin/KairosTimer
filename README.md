# KairosTimer
A desktop application that supports running multiple timers of different types concurrently

## Goals
Create a desktop application that allows users to run multiple timers at once. Users should be able to
- [ ] Create a new simple timer and run it
- [ ] Create an interval timer and run it
- [ ] Pause a timer in progress
- [ ] Run multiple timers at once
- [ ] Give timers and their intervals custom names and stylings
- [ ] Save and load timers

There's a thousand crappy timers out there. Hopefully this one ends up being better some day.
